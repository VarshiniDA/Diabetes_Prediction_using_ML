# Diabetes_Prediction_using_ML
For the implementation and tests I used Python programming language. The library
used to extract the algorithms and also to retrieve the data and display the results of
the algorithms is sklearn. As for reading the data file, with .csv extension we used the
Pandas library, and for extracting the data needed for the algorithms we used the
Numpy library. Next, preprocess data to remove missing data and Perform percentage
split of 80% to divide dataset as Training set and 20% to Test set. Select the machine
learning algorithm i.e. KNearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree,
Logistic regression, Random Forest. Build the classifier model for the mentioned
machine learning algorithm based on training set. Then, improve the obtained accuracy
by hyperparameter tuning. Next, test the Classifier model for the mentioned machine
learning algorithm based on test set. Perform Comparison Evaluation of the
experimental performance results obtained for each classifier. After analyzing based on
various measures conclude the best performing algorithm.
